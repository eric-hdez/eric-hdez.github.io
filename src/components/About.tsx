              Hi there, My name is Eric! I am 22 years old and recently graduated from the
              University of California, Santa Cruz with a B.S. in Computer Science. In February
              2024, I am relocating to New York City to start my career as a Software Engineer at
              Bloomberg LP.

              Outside of my professional pursuits, you can catch me embracing the beauty of nature
              on a hike, pushing myself at the gym, getting lost in the verses of romantic poets, or
              taking in the breath-taking beauty of the night sky. As a first generation
              Mexican-American, I recently discovered a passion for remaking some of my favorite
              traditional dishes from Mexican culture. I love sharing my culinary creations with
              friends and family to show my appreciation for them!

              I enjoy having conversations about tech or any of the hobbies that I am passionate
              about. Feel free to reach out to me via social media or email if you would like to
              have a chat!
